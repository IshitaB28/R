The file metricsDistribution.R consists of the histograms and boxplots of the metrics (degree, closeness, betweenness, eigen centrality, pagerank and clustering coefficient) of all the four networks (Openstack Changes, Openstack Comments, Eclipse Comments, Eclipse Changes). These plots are all there in the repository with their respective names.
Correlation_data.R shows the correlation of the metrics for each of the four networks.
The ERGM fits and the goodness of fits for the two networks of Openstack are in Final_Openstack.R and those of the two networks of Eclipse are in Eclipse.R
